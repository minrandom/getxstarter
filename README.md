# GetX Starter

A simple Flutter starter project using **GetX** for navigation and routing. This project includes a splash screen, a home page, login, and registration pages to serve as a reusable template for building apps with GetX.

## Features

- **Home Page**: A simple home screen after login.
- **Login & Registration**: Basic login and registration forms using GetX state management and routing.
- **GetX for Navigation**: Efficient navigation and routing using the GetX package.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

### Project Structure

This project follows a clean architecture with GetX for routing. Here's an overview of the core structure:

```plaintext
.
├── lib/
│   ├── main.dart             # Entry point of the app
│   ├── pages/                # Contains splash, home, login, and register pages
│   ├── controllers/          # GetX controllers for managing state
│   ├── routes/               # Routing and navigation setup with GetX
└── pubspec.yaml              # Project dependencies and assets
```

### Usage

- **Splash Screen**: Displays for a few seconds when the app launches, then navigates to the login page.
- **Login & Registration**: Use the simple form for authentication and navigate to the home page on successful login.

### Customization
